# 👀 About Me

My name is Yishuai Geng (耿宜帅), born on December 19, 1999. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Southeast University, under the supervision of Professor [Guohui Xiao](https://www.ghxiao.org/) （肖国辉）. Previously, I completed my Master's degree at Yangzhou University under the supervision of Professor [Zhu Yi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=jSfAPUwAAAAJ) （朱毅）.

My research focuses on **Knowledge Representation & Reasoning**, with a spotlight on the following key areas: 

- Answer Set Programming
- Large Language Model 
- Recommendation System

I have published 5 papers with total google scholar citations  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hpVroWYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
